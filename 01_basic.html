 <!-- Inline CSS -->
 <p>Inline css is not something a good programmer should do but you just have 
    to know. It makes coding look dirty.eg is seen in h1 below</p>
    <p>Internal css is done on thesame html page but is separate from the html. eg seen in h2</p>
    <p>External css you create the css code on a diff page and you later bring the file in.
        Out of there 3, this is the best to use</p>
    <h1 style="color: red">Heading One</h1>
    <h2>Heading Two</h2>
    <h3>Heading Three</h3>
